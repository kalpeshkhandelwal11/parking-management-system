# Introduction
Seeking a vacant parking space during peak hours in areas like Hospitals, Hotels & Shopping Centers, Airports, Universities, and Exhibitions & Convention Center has always been frustrating for many drivers. Surveys says that traffic generated by cars searching for vacancies in Parking Spaces is up to 40% of the total traffic. Now that is a serious issue to look after, and Smart Parking System is one of the best available solutions to at least reduce the traffic congestion caused due to the above problem. This application gives information about the occupancy status of the spaces in the parking lot equipped with sensors that detect the presence of vehicles.Smart Parking is an Internet of Things (IoT) based application, used to detect the available parking slots. This app uses ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a vehicle (whether the parking slot is occupied or not). Based on the parking slot occupancy, the status (occupied/unoccupied) is displayed on the web application dashboard. In real time, the environment have sensors and devices embedded into parking spaces, transmitting data on the occupancy status; and the vehicle drivers can search for parking availability using their mobile phones or any infotainment system that is attached to the vehicle. Hence the driver would know where there is an available spot to park his vehicle in less time, reducing the energy consumption and air pollution.
